# Loan Default Risk — Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a consumer finance dataset to examine patterns associated with loan default risk. Using applicant information, loan characteristics, and historical credit behavior, we explore how different factors relate to repayment difficulty and whether certain borrower segments show higher default tendencies.

The goal of this analysis is to identify potential risk drivers and uncover meaningful patterns in the data. This project focuses on descriptive insights and data understanding rather than building predictive or causal models.

This work was completed as part of a course EDA case study.

## What We Explored

* Overall distribution of the repayment outcome
* Key applicant characteristics (e.g., income, employment-related variables)
* Loan features such as loan amount, term, and pricing indicators
* Credit history variables and their relationship to default
* Basic comparisons between borrower groups

## Approach

The analysis includes:

* Data cleaning and missing value checks
* Summary statistics and distribution plots
* Outcome-based comparisons across key variables
* Visualization of patterns to support interpretation

All findings are exploratory and should be interpreted as correlations rather than causal relationships.
