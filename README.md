# Loan Default Risk — Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a consumer finance dataset to examine patterns associated with loan default risk. Using applicant information, loan characteristics, and historical credit behavior, we explore how different factors relate to repayment difficulty and whether certain borrower segments show higher default tendencies.

The goal of this analysis is to identify potential risk drivers and uncover meaningful patterns in the data. This project focuses on descriptive insights and data understanding rather than building predictive or causal models.

This work was completed as part of a course EDA case study.

The dataset includes both current loan application data and previous loan history, allowing us to examine how past credit behavior may influence current repayment outcomes.

## What We Explored

* Overall distribution of the repayment outcome and class imbalance
* Key applicant characteristics (e.g., income, demographics, asset ownership)
* Loan features such as credit amount and related financial variables
* Credit bureau request behavior and prior application history
* Interaction effects between income and loan size
* Basic comparisons between borrower groups to identify higher-risk segments

---

## Approach

The analysis includes:

* Data cleaning and missing value checks
* Summary statistics and distribution plots
* Outcome-based comparisons across key variables
* Aggregation of historical application data and merge with current records
* Visualization of patterns to support interpretation

All findings are exploratory and should be interpreted as correlations rather than causal relationships. The repository contains the notebook with code, a summary slide deck of key findings, and this README overview.
