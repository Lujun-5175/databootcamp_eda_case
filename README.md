# Loan Default Risk — Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a consumer finance dataset to examine patterns associated with loan default risk. Using applicant information, loan characteristics, and historical credit behavior, the analysis explores how different factors relate to repayment difficulty.

The goal of this project is to gain an initial understanding of potential risk drivers and segmentation patterns, rather than to build predictive or causal models.

This work was completed as part of a course EDA case study.
